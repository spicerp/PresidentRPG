# PresidentRPG
Presidential RPG Project for Intro to Java Class

This code is a basic rpg game in which you play as the President of the United States.

You have one major task to do, which is to sign bills and decide which ones are good and bad. 

The more you get right, the more points, the less you get right, the less amount of points.

You can use these hard earned points at the cafeteria, in which you will interact with a lunch lady.

She will provide you a menu in which you can spend on food.

You can walk around the map, and explore, this game can definitely eventually be developed even more.

NOTE: You might have to adjust where the code calls the txt files:
In the map and game Java files specifically.
